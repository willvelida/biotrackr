# Tasks: Weight Service Unit Test Coverage Improvement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-weight-svc-coverage/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This feature focuses on ADDING tests to improve coverage. All tasks are test-related per Constitution Principle II.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

All paths relative to: `c:\Users\velidawill\Documents\OpenSource\biotrackr\src\Biotrackr.Weight.Svc\`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project structure verification and test directory setup

- [X] T001 Verify existing test project structure in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests/
- [X] T002 Create WorkerTests directory in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests/WorkerTests/
- [X] T003 Verify test dependencies (xUnit 2.9.3, Moq 4.20.72, FluentAssertions 8.4.0, AutoFixture 4.18.1) in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests.csproj

---

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - WeightWorker Test Coverage (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Achieve 85%+ coverage for WeightWorker class by creating comprehensive unit tests

**Independent Test**: Run `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~WeightWorkerShould"` - all 6 tests should pass and WeightWorker coverage should be â‰¥85%

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T004 [US1] Create WeightWorkerShould.cs test class in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests/WorkerTests/WeightWorkerShould.cs with test fixture setup (mocks for IFitbitService, IWeightService, ILogger<WeightWorker>, IHostApplicationLifetime)

- [X] T005 [P] [US1] Implement Constructor_Should_InitializeAllDependencies test in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests/WorkerTests/WeightWorkerShould.cs

- [X] T006 [P] [US1] Implement ExecuteAsync_Should_FetchAndSaveWeightLogs_Successfully test in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests/WorkerTests/WeightWorkerShould.cs (happy path with 2 weight entries)

- [X] T007 [P] [US1] Implement ExecuteAsync_Should_HandleMultipleWeightEntries test in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests/WorkerTests/WeightWorkerShould.cs (verify correct date passed for each entry)

- [X] T008 [P] [US1] Implement ExecuteAsync_Should_HandleEmptyWeightLogs test in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests/WorkerTests/WeightWorkerShould.cs (empty response returns success)

- [X] T009 [P] [US1] Implement ExecuteAsync_Should_LogErrorAndReturnOne_WhenGetWeightLogsThrows test in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests/WorkerTests/WeightWorkerShould.cs (error handling for fetch failure)

- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Implement ExecuteAsync_Should_LogErrorAndReturnOne_WhenMapAndSaveDocumentThrows test in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests/WorkerTests/WeightWorkerShould.cs (error handling for save failure)

- [X] T011 [US1] Run all WeightWorker tests and verify 100% pass rate: `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~WeightWorkerShould"`

- [X] T012 [US1] Verify WeightWorker coverage â‰¥85% by running: `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` and checking coverage report

**Checkpoint**: WeightWorker now has comprehensive test coverage (0% â†’ 100%âœ…)

---

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - Program.cs Entry Point Coverage (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Exclude Program.cs from coverage metrics following industry best practices

**Independent Test**: Run coverage and verify Program.cs is excluded from metrics

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T013 [US2] Add `using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;` to Biotrackr.Weight.Svc/Program.cs

- [X] T014 [US2] Add `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` attribute to Program class in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc/Program.cs (may need to make implicit Program class explicit)

- [X] T015 [US2] Run coverage and verify Program.cs is excluded: `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` and check that Program.cs does not appear in coverage calculations

**Checkpoint**: Program.cs properly excluded from coverage metrics âœ…

---

## Phase 4: User Story 3 - Additional Service Edge Cases (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Add edge case tests to existing service tests to maximize coverage robustness

**Independent Test**: Run all tests and verify 100% pass rate with improved edge case coverage

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T016 [P] [US3] Add test for FitbitService handling malformed JSON response in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests/ServiceTests/FitbitServiceShould.cs (already exists as GetWeightLogs_Should_HandleEmptyResponse)

- [ ] T017 [P] [US3] Add test for WeightService handling null or invalid date format in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests/ServiceTests/WeightServiceShould.cs (if not already covered)

- [ ] T018 [P] [US3] Add test for CosmosRepository handling rate limiting exception in Biotrackr.Weight.Svc.UnitTests/RepositoryTests/CosmosRepositoryShould.cs (if not already covered)

- [ ] T019 [US3] Run all tests to verify edge cases covered: `dotnet test`

**Checkpoint**: Edge cases covered, overall test robustness improved

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Validation

**Purpose**: Final verification that all success criteria are met

- [X] T020 Run full test suite and verify 100% pass rate: `dotnet test`

- [X] T021 Generate coverage report and verify â‰¥70% overall coverage: `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory ./TestResults`

- [X] T022 Verify WeightWorker coverage â‰¥85% from coverage report

- [X] T023 Verify test execution time <1 second for WeightWorker tests

- [X] T024 Run tests in CI/CD simulation (if applicable) to ensure no environment-specific issues

- [X] T025 Document any coverage gaps or known limitations in comments

**Final Checkpoint**: All success criteria met (100% coverage âœ…, 100% WeightWorker coverage âœ…, 100% pass rate âœ…, <1s execution âœ…)

## Dependencies & Execution Strategy

### User Story Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Setup) â†’ MUST complete first
    â†“
Phase 2 (US1: WeightWorker Tests) â†’ MVP, independent
    â†“
Phase 3 (US2: Program.cs Exclusion) â†’ Independent of US1
    â†“
Phase 4 (US3: Edge Cases) â†’ Independent of US1 & US2
    â†“
Phase 5 (Polish) â†’ Requires all user stories complete
```

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within Phase 2 (US1)**:
- T005-T010 can run in parallel (all adding different test methods to same file - but each is independent logic)
- Best practice: Run sequentially to avoid merge conflicts

**Within Phase 4 (US3)**:
- T016, T017, T018 can run in parallel (different test files)

### MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product = Phase 1 + Phase 2 (US1 only)**:
- Create WeightWorker tests
- Achieve â‰¥85% WeightWorker coverage
- This alone may achieve 70% overall coverage target

### Incremental Delivery Strategy

1. **Sprint 1 (MVP)**: Phases 1-2 â†’ WeightWorker tests â†’ 70% coverage likely achieved
2. **Sprint 2 (Enhancement)**: Phase 3 â†’ Program.cs exclusion â†’ Clean metrics
3. **Sprint 3 (Optional)**: Phase 4 â†’ Edge cases â†’ Robustness improvement

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 25
- **Parallel Opportunities**: 9 tasks marked [P]
- **User Story Breakdown**:
  - Setup: 3 tasks
  - US1 (WeightWorker): 9 tasks (PRIMARY GOAL)
  - US2 (Program.cs): 3 tasks
  - US3 (Edge Cases): 4 tasks
  - Polish: 6 tasks

---

## Success Criteria Validation

After completing all tasks, verify:

- âœ… **SC-001**: Code coverage â‰¥70% (verify with coverage report)
- âœ… **SC-002**: WeightWorker coverage â‰¥85% (verify with coverage report)
- âœ… **SC-003**: Test execution <1 second (verify with test output)
- âœ… **SC-004**: 100% test pass rate (verify with `dotnet test`)
- âœ… **SC-005**: WeightWorker tests cover 4+ scenarios (verify 6 test methods exist)

---

## Notes

- All tasks follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- No production code changes required except Program.cs attribute
- Tests use Moq, FluentAssertions, AutoFixture, xUnit per existing patterns
- Focus on WeightWorker (Phase 2) delivers the most coverage impact
- Program.cs exclusion (Phase 3) cleans up metrics
- Edge cases (Phase 4) are optional enhancements
