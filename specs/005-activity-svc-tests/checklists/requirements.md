# Specification Quality Checklist: Activity Service Test Coverage and Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 31, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items validated successfully (Updated after clarification session)

**Clarification Session (2025-10-31)**:
- ✅ 2 clarification questions asked and answered
- ✅ Flaky test handling strategy: Remove flaky tests entirely from test suite
- ✅ Fixture architecture: Use separate ContractTestFixture and IntegrationTestFixture (Weight API pattern)

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ Specification is technology-agnostic (focuses on testing outcomes, not specific tools)
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable with concrete metrics (70% coverage, 5-second execution times, 10-minute workflow completion)
- ✅ User scenarios are prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
- ✅ All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-043) are clear and testable
- ✅ Edge cases comprehensively documented (10 distinct scenarios)
- ✅ Scope is well-bounded with clear "Out of Scope" section
- ✅ Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all decisions made with reasonable defaults or clarified
- ✅ References to existing patterns (Weight Service) and decision records included
- ✅ Clarifications integrated into appropriate specification sections

**Updated Sections**:
- Clarifications section added with Session 2025-10-31
- FR-013, FR-014: Updated to specify separate ContractTestFixture and IntegrationTestFixture
- FR-023: Added requirement for contract tests to use ContractTestFixture
- FR-033, FR-034: Added requirements for E2E tests to use IntegrationTestFixture and remove flaky tests
- Key Entities: Separated ContractTestFixture and IntegrationTestFixture definitions
- References: Added Contract Test Architecture and Flaky Test Handling decision records

**Notes**:
- Specification leverages existing Weight Service integration test patterns for consistency
- Program.cs exclusion from coverage follows established decision record (2025-10-28)
- Test organization (Contract vs E2E) aligns with existing project standards
- GitHub Actions workflow integration follows reusable template patterns
- Fixture architecture matches Weight API pattern from decision record 2025-10-28-contract-test-architecture.md
- Flaky test policy differs from Weight API (remove vs skip) per user preference

**Ready for Planning**: Yes - Specification is complete with all clarifications integrated and ready for `/speckit.plan`
