## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Can start immediately (expands existing tests) - RECOMMENDED FIRST
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on User Story 2 completion (needs fixtures)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 2 completion (needs fixtures)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on User Stories 1, 3, and 4 completion (needs working tests)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Independent - No dependencies on other stories (works with existing unit tests)
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Creates infrastructure for US3 and US4
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US2 (needs ContractTestFixture) - Independent from US4
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Depends on US2 (needs IntegrationTestFixture) - Independent from US3
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Depends on US1, US3, US4 (needs all tests working)

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 (Unit Tests)**:
- T018 (coverage exclusion) before T027 (coverage verification)
- T019-T026 (test additions) can all run in parallel [P]
- T027-T029 (verification) run sequentially after tests added

**User Story 2 (Project Creation)**:
- T030-T037 all parallelizable [P] (different files)
- T038-T041 sequential (depends on fixtures being created)

**User Story 3 (Contract Tests)**:
- T042-T051 all parallelizable [P] (different test methods)
- T052-T053 sequential (verification)

**User Story 4 (E2E Tests)**:
- T054-T068 all parallelizable [P] (different test methods/classes)
- T069-T072 sequential (execution and verification)

**User Story 5 (Workflow)**:
- T074-T075 can run in parallel with T076-T084
- T086-T090 sequential (execution and verification)

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T003 and T004 can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T007-T013 (NuGet packages) all run in parallel, T015-T016 run in parallel

**Phase 3 (US1)**: T019-T026 (test implementations) all run in parallel

**Phase 4 (US2)**: T030-T037 (fixture/helper classes) all run in parallel

**Phase 5 (US3)**: T042-T051 (contract tests) all run in parallel

**Phase 6 (US4)**: T054-T068 (E2E tests) all run in parallel

**Phase 7 (US5)**: T074-T075 and T076-T084 can overlap

**Phase 8 (Polish)**: T091-T093 (documentation) all run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Unit Test Expansion)

```bash
# All edge case tests can be written in parallel
# Assign to different developers or work on in parallel branches

# Developer 1: Worker tests
git checkout -b us1-worker-tests
# Implement T019, T020, T021

# Developer 2: Service tests  
git checkout -b us1-service-tests
# Implement T022, T023

# Developer 3: Repository tests
git checkout -b us1-repository-tests
# Implement T024, T025, T026

# Then merge all branches and run T027-T029 for verification
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 3 (Contract Tests)

```bash
# All contract tests can be written in parallel

# Developer 1: Program startup tests
git checkout -b us3-program-tests
# Implement T042-T045

# Developer 2: Service registration tests
git checkout -b us3-registration-tests
# Implement T046-T051

# Then merge and run T052-T053 for verification
```

## Recommended MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product** includes:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Setup
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Foundational
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: User Story 1 (Unit Test Coverage - P1)

This MVP delivers immediate value by achieving 70% code coverage and improving test quality without requiring integration test infrastructure.

**Extended MVP** (recommended):
- ‚úÖ All of Minimum MVP
- ‚úÖ Phase 4: User Story 2 (Integration Test Project - P2)
- ‚úÖ Phase 5: User Story 3 (Contract Tests - P2)

This provides a complete testing foundation with fast contract tests that validate service configuration.

**Full Implementation**:
- All phases including E2E tests (US4) and CI/CD integration (US5)

---

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with MVP**: Implement Phase 1-3 (User Story 1) first to achieve 70% coverage goal
2. **Build infrastructure**: Add Phase 4 (User Story 2) to establish test project structure
3. **Add contract tests**: Implement Phase 5 (User Story 3) for fast service validation
4. **Add E2E tests**: Implement Phase 6 (User Story 4) for comprehensive integration testing
5. **Automate in CI/CD**: Implement Phase 7 (User Story 5) to catch regressions
6. **Polish**: Complete Phase 8 for documentation and developer experience

Each phase delivers independently testable value and can be merged incrementally.
