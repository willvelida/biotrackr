# Tasks: Enhanced Test Coverage for Activity API

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-activity-api-tests/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), spec.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

**Tests**: REQUIRED per Constitution Principle II - comprehensive testing following test pyramid (unit ≥80%, integration contract + E2E)

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## ⚠️ Critical Lessons from Weight API Implementation

**These tasks have been updated based on decision records and common resolutions to avoid past mistakes:**

1. **Service Lifetime Registration** (2025-10-28-service-lifetime-registration.md)
   - ❌ DON'T duplicate service registrations with `AddHttpClient<TInterface, TImplementation>()`
   - ✅ DO use appropriate lifetimes: Singleton (Azure SDK clients), Scoped (app services), Transient (HttpClient services)
   - See: T084

2. **Contract vs E2E Test Architecture** (2025-10-28-contract-test-architecture.md)
   - ❌ DON'T use full IntegrationTestFixture for contract tests (unnecessary DB dependency)
   - ✅ DO create ContractTestFixture with `InitializeDatabase => false` for fast validation
   - See: T012-T016, T069-T080

3. **Test Data Isolation** (common-resolutions.md)
   - ❌ DON'T assume Cosmos DB container is empty between tests
   - ✅ DO implement `ClearContainerAsync()` and call before each E2E test
   - See: T086-T090

4. **Configuration Format** (2025-10-28-dotnet-configuration-format.md)
   - ❌ DON'T use double underscore in environment variables (`Biotrackr__DatabaseName`)
   - ✅ DO use colon-separated format (`Biotrackr:DatabaseName`)
   - See: T108

5. **Program.cs Coverage Exclusion** (2025-10-28-program-entry-point-coverage-exclusion.md)
   - ❌ DON'T try to unit test Program.cs entry point
   - ✅ DO exclude with `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` attribute, validate via integration tests
   - See: T018

6. **Flaky Test Handling** (2025-10-28-flaky-test-handling.md)
   - ❌ DON'T let environment-specific issues block CI
   - ✅ DO use `[Fact(Skip = "Flaky in CI: reason")]` for Cosmos DB Emulator timeouts
   - See: T094, T135

7. **Integration Test Folder Structure** (2025-10-28-integration-test-project-structure.md)
   - ❌ DON'T use flat structure mixing contract and E2E tests
   - ✅ DO organize as: `Contract/`, `E2E/`, `Fixtures/`, `Collections/`, `Helpers/`
   - See: T069, T085, T137

8. **GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration** (common-resolutions.md)
   - ❌ DON'T point working-directory to solution folder
   - ✅ DO use specific test project paths (e.g., `./src/Project/Project.UnitTests`)
   - ❌ DON'T forget `checks: write` permission for test reporter action
   - See: T102, T107, T110

9. **Service Registration in Tests** (common-resolutions.md)
   - ❌ DON'T use `AddSingleton(null)` - throws ArgumentNullException
   - ✅ DO use mocking libraries or omit registration if not needed
   - See: T013

**Result**: These updates prevent repeating mistakes that caused 50+ commits in Weight API test implementation.

## Dependencies Between User Stories

### Story Completion Order

1. **US1 (P1)** → Independent (can start immediately)
   - No dependencies
   - Requires only existing codebase
   - MVP scope: Complete this first

2. **US2 (P2)** → Depends on Foundational phase
   - Requires test fixtures from Phase 2
   - Can proceed independently once Phase 2 complete
   - Integration tests build on unit test patterns

3. **US3 (P3)** → Depends on US1 + US2
   - Requires completed test suites to automate
   - Cannot proceed until tests are implemented
   - Final delivery phase

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within US1 (P1)**:
- All test creation tasks (T019-T059) can run in parallel
- Each component's tests are independent
- Coverage verification (T060-T068) must run after all tests complete

**Within US2 (P2)**:
- Contract tests (T069-T084) and E2E tests (T085-T094) can be developed in parallel after fixtures complete
- Service lifetime tests can run in parallel with smoke tests
- Integration test execution (T095-T100) must run after implementation complete

**Within US3 (P3)**:
- Workflow configuration (T101-T110) and quality gates (T111-T115) can be developed in parallel
- Workflow testing (T116-T122) must run after configuration complete

**Across Phase 6**:
- All documentation tasks (T123-T127) can run in parallel
- All optimization tasks (T128-T131) can run in parallel
- Validation tasks must run sequentially as they build on each other
