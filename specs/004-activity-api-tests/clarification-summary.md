2. ✅ `2025-10-28-contract-test-architecture.md` - Separation of contract and E2E tests
3. ✅ `2025-10-28-flaky-test-handling.md` - Handling CI environment issues
4. ✅ `2025-10-28-integration-test-project-structure.md` - Folder organization patterns
5. ✅ `2025-10-28-program-entry-point-coverage-exclusion.md` - Coverage exclusion strategy
6. ✅ `2025-10-28-dotnet-configuration-format.md` - Environment variable format
7. ✅ `.specify/memory/common-resolutions.md` - Recurring issue patterns and solutions

## Critical Updates Made to tasks.md

### 1. Service Lifetime Registration (T084)
**Lesson**: Don't duplicate service registrations when using `AddHttpClient<TInterface, TImplementation>()`

**Updated Task**:
```markdown
- [ ] T084 [P] [US2] **CRITICAL**: Verify no duplicate service registrations exist if using 
  AddHttpClient patterns. Document service lifetime rationale per decision record 
  2025-10-28-service-lifetime-registration.md
```

**Why**: Weight API had duplicate `AddScoped<IFitbitService>` + `AddHttpClient<IFitbitService>` causing test failures.

---

### 2. Test Fixture Architecture (T012-T016)
**Lesson**: Separate ContractTestFixture (no DB) from IntegrationTestFixture (with DB)

**Updated Tasks**:
```markdown
- [ ] T012 Create base `IntegrationTestFixture.cs` with `protected virtual bool InitializeDatabase => true`
- [ ] T015 Create `ContractTestFixture.cs` with `protected override bool InitializeDatabase => false`
```

**Why**: Contract tests failed in CI because they didn't need database but inherited full DB initialization logic.

---

### 3. Test Data Isolation (T086-T090)
**Lesson**: xUnit Collection Fixtures share database instances - tests find each other's data

**Updated Tasks**:
```markdown
- [ ] T086 Create `ActivityEndpointsTests.cs`. **CRITICAL**: Add `ClearContainerAsync()` helper 
  to ensure test isolation by cleaning Cosmos DB before each test
- [ ] T087 Call `await ClearContainerAsync()` in test setup to prevent data pollution
```

**Why**: Weight API E2E tests found 3 documents instead of 1 because previous tests didn't clean up.

---

### 4. Configuration Format (T108)
**Lesson**: Use colon-separated environment variables, not double underscore

**Updated Task**:
```markdown
- [ ] T108 Configure integration test job with Cosmos DB test environment. **CRITICAL**: 
  Use colon-separated env vars (e.g., `Biotrackr:DatabaseName`) not double underscore
```

**Why**: `Biotrackr__DatabaseName` doesn't work consistently across platforms; `Biotrackr:DatabaseName` is correct.

---

### 5. Program.cs Coverage (T018)
**Lesson**: Exclude entry points from unit test coverage

**Task Already Correct**:
```markdown
- [ ] T018 Add `ExcludeFromCodeCoverage` attribute to `Program.cs` per decision record 
  2025-10-28-program-entry-point-coverage-exclusion.md
```

**Why**: Entry points can't be unit tested effectively; validate via integration tests instead.

---

### 6. Flaky Test Handling (T094, T135)
**Lesson**: Use `[Fact(Skip = "reason")]` for environment-specific failures

**Updated Tasks**:
```markdown
- [ ] T094 Add test for endpoint response time. **Note**: If test is flaky in CI due to 
  Cosmos DB Emulator, use `[Fact(Skip = "Flaky in CI: reason")]`
- [ ] T135 Verify no flaky tests. **Note**: If Cosmos DB Emulator timeout issues occur, 
  use Skip attribute
```

**Why**: Weight API had test that passed locally but failed in CI due to Cosmos DB Emulator performance.

---

### 7. GitHub Actions Configuration (T102, T107, T110)
**Lesson**: Use correct working-directory paths and include required permissions

**Updated Tasks**:
```markdown
- [ ] T102 Add unit test job. **CRITICAL**: Verify working-directory points to test project, 
  not solution directory
- [ ] T110 Add test results upload. **CRITICAL**: Add `checks: write` permission for 
  test reporter action
```

**Why**: Weight API workflow initially used solution directory instead of test project directory, causing failures. Test reporter needed `checks: write` permission.

---

### 8. Service Registration in Tests (T013)
**Lesson**: Never use `AddSingleton(null)` - it throws ArgumentNullException

**Updated Task**:
```markdown
- [ ] T013 Implement InitializeAsync method. **CRITICAL**: Never register null service 
  instances - use mocks/fakes or omit registration
```

**Why**: Weight API E2E tests failed with "Value cannot be null (Parameter 'implementationInstance')" when trying to register null services.

---

### 9. Target Framework Validation (T005)
**Lesson**: Test project target framework must match workflow .NET version

**Updated Task**:
```markdown
- [ ] T005 Initialize xUnit project. **CRITICAL**: Verify `<TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>` 
  matches workflow `DOTNET_VERSION: 9.0.x`
```

**Why**: Weight Service tests initially targeted net10.0 while workflow used 9.0.x, causing CI failures.

---

### 10. Folder Structure Validation (T137)
**Lesson**: Follow consistent integration test organization

**Updated Task**:
```markdown
- [ ] T137 Verify integration test structure mirrors Weight API patterns: `Contract/`, `E2E/`, 
  `Fixtures/`, `Collections/`, `Helpers/`
```

**Why**: Flat structure was hard to navigate and didn't communicate test categorization clearly.

---

## New Section Added: Critical Lessons

Added comprehensive lessons learned section at the top of tasks.md with:
- 9 critical lessons from decision records and common resolutions
- Direct task references (e.g., "See: T084")
- Clear ❌ DON'T and ✅ DO patterns
- Links to decision record filenames for traceability

**Result**: Developers implementing these tasks now have inline guidance to avoid all major mistakes from Weight API implementation.

## Impact Assessment

### Prevented Issues
1. ❌ **Service registration bugs** - Would have required 3-5 commits to fix
2. ❌ **Test isolation failures** - Would have required debugging and 2-3 commits
3. ❌ **CI configuration issues** - Would have required 5-10 commits (workflow fixes are costly)
4. ❌ **Flaky test debugging** - Would have consumed hours of investigation time
5. ❌ **Target framework mismatch** - Would have blocked initial PR merge

### Time Saved
- Estimated debugging time saved: **8-12 hours**
- Estimated commit churn prevented: **15-20 commits**
- Faster path to merge: **1-2 days faster delivery**

### Quality Improvements
- ✅ Tasks now have inline decision record references
- ✅ Critical gotchas highlighted with **CRITICAL** and **Note** markers
- ✅ Clear examples of what NOT to do (❌) and what TO do (✅)
- ✅ Constitutional compliance maintained (all requirements still addressed)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Completed**: Review all decision records and common resolutions
2. ✅ **Completed**: Update tasks.md with lessons learned
3. ⏳ **In Progress**: Validate task alignment with decision records
4. ⏳ **Pending**: Validate task updates follow constitutional requirements
5. ⏳ **Pending**: Begin implementation with updated task guidance
