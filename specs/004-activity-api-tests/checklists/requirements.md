# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Test Coverage for Activity API

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed:

### Content Quality Assessment
- Specification focuses on testing requirements without prescribing implementation technologies
- Written from development team perspective (the users of the test infrastructure)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are completed with concrete details

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete and actionable
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., "MUST achieve ≥80% code coverage" can be verified with coverage tools)
- Success criteria are measurable and quantifiable (e.g., "Unit test coverage increases to ≥80%", "tests execute within 5 minutes")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details - they focus on outcomes rather than how to achieve them
- All acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format and are clearly defined
- Edge cases comprehensively cover boundary conditions, error scenarios, and integration failure modes
- Scope is clearly bounded to Activity API unit and integration tests following Weight API patterns
- Assumptions section clearly identifies dependencies on Azure resources, test framework, and existing patterns

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- All 21 functional requirements are actionable and testable
- User scenarios cover all three priority levels with independent test strategies
- Success criteria provide clear, measurable outcomes that validate feature completion
- Specification maintains appropriate abstraction level without leaking technical implementation details

## Notes

The specification successfully:
1. Reuses proven patterns from Weight API (fixtures, collections, WebApplicationFactory)
2. Maintains consistency with project constitution (80% coverage requirement)
3. Provides clear separation between contract tests (fast, no DB) and E2E tests (full integration)
4. Identifies all relevant edge cases specific to Activity API domain (Fitbit entities, heart rate zones, distance measurements)
5. Establishes concrete, verifiable success criteria for both unit and integration test implementation
