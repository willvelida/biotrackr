# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Test Coverage for Weight API

**Branch**: `001-weight-api-tests` | **Date**: 2025-10-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-weight-api-tests/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Extend the existing unit test suite for Biotrackr.Weight.Api from 39% to ≥80% code coverage and add comprehensive integration tests. Create a new integration test project (Biotrackr.Weight.Api.IntegrationTests) that runs against the DEV environment in GitHub Actions workflows. This directly supports the constitutional requirement for comprehensive testing strategy (Principle II) while ensuring quality gates prevent technical debt accumulation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: .NET 9.0 (C#)  
**Primary Dependencies**: xUnit 2.9.3, FluentAssertions 8.4.0, Moq 4.20.72, AutoFixture 4.18.1, coverlet.collector 6.0.4  
**Storage**: Azure Cosmos DB (for integration tests), In-memory mocks (for unit tests)  
**Testing**: xUnit framework with existing test infrastructure  
**Target Platform**: Linux containers in Azure Container Apps, GitHub Actions runners (ubuntu-latest)
**Project Type**: Web API with microservice architecture  
**Performance Goals**: Unit tests <5 minutes execution, Integration tests <15 minutes execution, Coverage reports generation <30 seconds  
**Constraints**: ≥80% code coverage requirement (constitutional), Integration tests must use isolated test environment, Test failures must block deployment pipeline  
**Scale/Scope**: Single Weight API service, ~15 test classes, ~150+ test methods expected, GitHub Actions workflow integration

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Initial Check (Pre-Phase 0):**
- [x] **Code Quality Excellence**: Test design follows SOLID principles with clear separation of unit vs integration concerns, maintainable test structure
- [x] **Testing Strategy**: Test pyramid implemented (unit ≥80%, focused integration tests, CI/CD automation), TDD approach for new test creation
- [x] **User Experience**: Consistent test patterns across all test projects, clear test naming and documentation
- [x] **Performance Requirements**: Test execution time limits defined (unit <5min, integration <15min), coverage reporting performance optimized
- [x] **Technical Debt**: Current 39% coverage debt identified, systematic remediation plan with measurable targets, GitHub Issues for tracking progress

**Post-Phase 1 Design Re-evaluation:**
- [x] **Code Quality Excellence**: Detailed test architecture maintains SOLID principles, clear separation between unit and integration test projects
- [x] **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test pyramid design with specific coverage targets per component, TDD workflow defined in contracts
- [x] **User Experience**: Consistent API testing patterns defined, standardized error handling and response validation
- [x] **Performance Requirements**: Detailed performance targets with optimization strategies, monitoring and alerting for test execution times
- [x] **Technical Debt**: Systematic approach to coverage improvement with clear quality gates and automated enforcement

**Gate Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All constitutional requirements satisfied with detailed implementation plan

**Structure Decision**: Microservice architecture with separated test concerns. Unit tests extend existing project structure while integration tests are isolated in a new project to maintain clean separation between fast unit tests and slower integration tests. This aligns with the constitutional testing strategy requiring clear test pyramid implementation.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
