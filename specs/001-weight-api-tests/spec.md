# Feature Specification: Enhanced Test Coverage for Weight API

**Feature Branch**: `001-weight-api-tests`  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Extend the unit tests for Biotrackr.Weight.Api so that they meet the 80% code coverage requirements. Also add Integration Tests that can be run within a GitHub Actions workflow file."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage (Priority: P1)

Development teams need comprehensive unit test coverage for the Weight API to ensure code quality and reliability. The current test coverage is insufficient at 39%, requiring additional unit tests to achieve the constitutional requirement of 80% coverage.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for code quality assurance and is mandated by the project constitution. Without adequate unit test coverage, the codebase becomes fragile and error-prone.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running unit tests with coverage reporting and verifying that coverage meets or exceeds 80% threshold across all code components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Weight API codebase, **When** unit tests are executed with coverage analysis, **Then** overall code coverage should be ≥80%
2. **Given** any code component (handlers, repositories, models, extensions), **When** unit tests are run, **Then** each component should have comprehensive test coverage including edge cases
3. **Given** exception scenarios and error conditions, **When** unit tests are executed, **Then** all error handling paths should be tested and verified

---

### User Story 2 - Integration Test Implementation (Priority: P2)

Development teams need integration tests that verify the Weight API works correctly with external dependencies (Cosmos DB, Azure services) and can be executed in automated CI/CD pipelines.

**Why this priority**: Integration tests ensure that components work together correctly and catch issues that unit tests might miss. They are essential for confident deployments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running integration tests in a controlled environment and verifying they pass consistently in GitHub Actions workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Weight API deployed in a test environment, **When** integration tests are executed, **Then** all API endpoints should function correctly with real dependencies
2. **Given** a GitHub Actions workflow, **When** the workflow is triggered, **Then** integration tests should run automatically and report results
3. **Given** various data scenarios and edge cases, **When** integration tests are executed, **Then** the API should handle them correctly in an integrated environment

---

### User Story 3 - CI/CD Test Automation (Priority: P3)

Development teams need automated test execution in GitHub Actions workflows to ensure continuous quality assurance and prevent regressions from reaching production.

**Why this priority**: Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines ensures consistent quality gates and enables confident continuous deployment practices.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering GitHub Actions workflows and verifying that all tests execute successfully with proper reporting and failure handling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request or code push, **When** GitHub Actions workflows are triggered, **Then** all unit and integration tests should execute automatically
2. **Given** test failures in the CI/CD pipeline, **When** the workflow completes, **Then** clear failure reports should be provided with actionable information
3. **Given** successful test execution, **When** the workflow completes, **Then** test coverage reports should be generated and made available

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Cosmos DB is unavailable during integration tests?
- How does the system handle malformed date formats in various endpoints?
- What occurs when pagination parameters exceed reasonable limits?
- How are null or empty responses from the repository handled?
- What happens when Azure App Configuration is unavailable during startup?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Unit tests MUST achieve ≥80% code coverage across all Weight API components (handlers, repositories, models, extensions, configuration)
- **FR-002**: Unit tests MUST cover all public methods, properties, and constructors in the Weight API codebase
- **FR-003**: Unit tests MUST include comprehensive error handling scenarios for all exception types
- **FR-004**: Unit tests MUST validate all edge cases including boundary conditions, null inputs, and invalid data formats
- **FR-005**: Integration tests MUST verify end-to-end functionality of all Weight API endpoints with real dependencies
- **FR-006**: Integration tests MUST validate API responses, status codes, and data integrity in realistic scenarios
- **FR-007**: Integration tests MUST include authentication and authorization scenarios where applicable
- **FR-008**: Integration tests MUST verify database operations (read, write, query) work correctly with Cosmos DB
- **FR-009**: GitHub Actions workflow MUST execute all unit tests and report coverage metrics
- **FR-010**: GitHub Actions workflow MUST execute integration tests in an isolated test environment
- **FR-011**: Test failures MUST prevent workflow success and provide clear diagnostic information
- **FR-012**: Test execution MUST complete within reasonable time limits (unit tests <5 minutes, integration tests <15 minutes)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Unit Test Suite**: Comprehensive collection of tests covering all code paths, edge cases, and error scenarios
- **Integration Test Suite**: End-to-end tests that verify API functionality with real dependencies and infrastructure
- **Coverage Report**: Detailed analysis of code coverage metrics showing tested and untested code paths
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Automated CI/CD pipeline configuration that executes tests and reports results
- **Test Environment**: Isolated infrastructure setup for running integration tests safely

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Unit test coverage increases from current 39% to ≥80% across all Weight API components
- **SC-002**: All unit tests execute successfully within 5 minutes in local and CI/CD environments
- **SC-003**: Integration tests execute successfully within 15 minutes in GitHub Actions workflows
- **SC-004**: Zero test failures in CI/CD pipeline for valid code changes
- **SC-005**: Test coverage reports are generated and accessible for every build
- **SC-006**: Integration tests catch at least 95% of integration-related issues before production deployment
- **SC-007**: GitHub Actions workflows provide clear pass/fail status and diagnostic information within 30 seconds of completion

## Assumptions

- Azure test environment resources (Cosmos DB, App Configuration) are available for integration testing
- GitHub Actions has necessary permissions and secrets configured for Azure resource access
- Existing unit test framework (xUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq) will continue to be used
- Integration tests will use separate test databases to avoid impacting production data
- Test data cleanup will be handled automatically after integration test execution
- Current API endpoints and data models will remain stable during test implementation
