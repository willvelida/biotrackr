# Data Model: Enhanced Test Coverage for Weight API

**Phase**: 1 - Design & Contracts  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Complete

## Test Entities

### Unit Test Suite
**Purpose**: Comprehensive collection of unit tests covering all code paths and edge cases

**Key Attributes**:
- Test class organization by component (Handlers, Repositories, Models, Extensions, Configuration)
- Individual test methods with descriptive names following Given-When-Then pattern
- Mock dependencies with Moq framework
- Test data generation with AutoFixture
- Coverage tracking with coverlet.collector

**Validation Rules**:
- Each public method must have corresponding test methods
- All exception paths must be tested
- Edge cases must be covered (null inputs, boundary conditions)
- Test methods must be independent and isolated
- Test names must clearly describe the scenario being tested

**State Transitions**:
- Created → Passing → Maintained
- Failing tests block CI/CD pipeline progression

### Integration Test Suite
**Purpose**: End-to-end tests verifying API functionality with real dependencies

**Key Attributes**:
- WebApplicationFactory for full application testing
- Real Azure Cosmos DB connections with test database
- HTTP client testing of API endpoints
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Health check endpoint validation

**Validation Rules**:
- Tests must use isolated test database
- Test data must be cleaned up after execution
- Tests must handle async operations correctly
- Authentication tokens must be valid for test environment
- Response validation must include status codes and content

**State Transitions**:
- Setup → Execute → Cleanup → Report Results

### Coverage Report
**Purpose**: Detailed analysis of code coverage metrics and quality gates

**Key Attributes**:
- Overall coverage percentage
- Component-level coverage breakdown
- Line coverage, branch coverage, method coverage
- Coverage trends over time
- Uncovered code identification

**Validation Rules**:
- Overall coverage must be ≥80%
- New code coverage must be ≥90%
- Coverage reports must be generated for every build
- Coverage degradation must trigger alerts

### Test Environment Configuration
**Purpose**: Isolated infrastructure setup for running integration tests safely

**Key Attributes**:
- Separate Cosmos DB database for testing
- Test-specific application configuration
- Managed identity configuration for Azure services
- Network isolation from production resources

**Validation Rules**:
- Test environment must be completely isolated from production
- Test data must never contain real user information
- Environment must be automatically provisioned and cleaned up
- Configuration must support parallel test execution

### GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration
**Purpose**: Automated CI/CD pipeline configuration for test execution and reporting

**Key Attributes**:
- Separate jobs for unit tests and integration tests
- Matrix builds for different test categories
- Artifact collection for coverage reports
- Conditional execution based on code changes

**Validation Rules**:
- Unit tests must complete within 5 minutes
- Integration tests must complete within 15 minutes
- Test failures must block deployment pipeline
- Coverage reports must be published as artifacts

## Test Data Relationships

### Unit Test Data
- **Test Fixtures**: Shared setup code for test classes
- **Mock Objects**: Simulated dependencies using Moq framework
- **Test Data Builders**: AutoFixture configurations for consistent test data
- **Assertion Helpers**: FluentAssertions extensions for readable test verification

### Integration Test Data
- **Test Database**: Isolated Cosmos DB database with predictable schema
- **Seed Data**: Minimal dataset required for comprehensive testing
- **Test Users**: Synthetic user accounts for authentication testing
- **Cleanup Procedures**: Automated data removal after test execution

## Test Execution Flow

### Unit Test Execution
1. **Setup**: Initialize mocks and test data using AutoFixture
2. **Act**: Execute the method under test with prepared inputs
3. **Assert**: Verify outputs and interactions using FluentAssertions
4. **Cleanup**: Dispose of resources (handled automatically by xUnit)

### Integration Test Execution
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure WebApplicationFactory with test settings
2. **Database Preparation**: Ensure clean test database state
3. **Test Execution**: Make HTTP requests to API endpoints
4. **Response Validation**: Verify HTTP status codes, headers, and content
5. **Data Verification**: Confirm database state changes
6. **Cleanup**: Remove test data and dispose of resources

## Coverage Tracking Strategy

### Component Coverage Targets
- **EndpointHandlers**: ≥90% (critical business logic)
- **Repositories**: ≥85% (data access patterns)
- **Models**: ≥95% (simple data structures)
- **Extensions**: ≥80% (utility methods)
- **Configuration**: ≥75% (setup and validation)

### Exclusions from Coverage
- Program.cs startup code (integration tested)
- Generated code and attributes
- Third-party library integrations (tested via integration tests)
- Exception constructors and trivial properties

## Quality Gates

### Unit Test Quality Gates
- All tests must pass (0 failures)
- Coverage must meet component-specific targets
- Test execution time must be <5 minutes
- No code duplication in test methods

### Integration Test Quality Gates
- All critical user journeys must pass
- Database operations must complete successfully
- API responses must match OpenAPI specifications
- Test execution time must be <15 minutes

### Overall Quality Gates
- Combined coverage must be ≥80%
- No high-severity static analysis violations
- All tests must be deterministic (no flaky tests)
- Test maintenance burden must be sustainable
