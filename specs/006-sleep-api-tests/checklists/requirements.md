# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Test Coverage for Sleep API

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-31  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and pass the quality criteria. The specification is ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**Issues Identified and Resolved**:
1. Removed technology-specific references from Functional Requirements (xUnit, WebApplicationFactory, Cosmos DB)
2. Made Success Criteria more technology-agnostic (removed GitHub Actions, Cosmos DB Emulator references)
3. Generalized Assumptions section to avoid implementation details
4. Simplified Dependencies section to focus on categories rather than specific versions
5. Generalized Out of Scope to avoid service-specific references

## Notes

- Specification follows established patterns from Weight API and Activity API implementations
- All requirements focus on WHAT needs to be tested, not HOW to implement tests
- Edge cases comprehensively cover boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Success criteria are measurable and verifiable without knowledge of implementation
