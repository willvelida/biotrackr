# Feature Specification: Enhanced Test Coverage for Sleep API

**Feature Branch**: `006-sleep-api-tests`  
**Created**: 2025-10-31  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Expand unit test coverage for the Sleep API and add integration tests that can be run via GitHub Actions"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage (Priority: P1)

Development teams need comprehensive unit test coverage for the Sleep API to ensure code quality and reliability. The current unit test coverage needs to be analyzed and expanded to meet the constitutional requirement of 80% coverage across all code components.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for code quality assurance and is mandated by the project constitution. Without adequate unit test coverage, the codebase becomes fragile and error-prone.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running unit tests with coverage reporting and verifying that coverage meets or exceeds 80% threshold across all code components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Sleep API codebase, **When** unit tests are executed with coverage analysis, **Then** overall code coverage should be ≥80%
2. **Given** any code component (handlers, repositories, models, extensions, configuration), **When** unit tests are run, **Then** each component should have comprehensive test coverage including edge cases
3. **Given** exception scenarios and error conditions, **When** unit tests are executed, **Then** all error handling paths should be tested and verified
4. **Given** uncovered code paths identified in coverage reports, **When** new tests are added, **Then** they should target specific gaps to incrementally improve coverage

---

### User Story 2 - Integration Test Implementation (Priority: P2)

Development teams need integration tests that verify the Sleep API works correctly with external dependencies (Cosmos DB, Azure services) and can be executed in automated CI/CD pipelines, following the same patterns established in the Weight API and Activity API integration tests.

**Why this priority**: Integration tests ensure that components work together correctly and catch issues that unit tests might miss. They are essential for confident deployments and consistency across microservices.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running integration tests in a controlled environment and verifying they pass consistently in GitHub Actions workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Sleep API deployed in a test environment, **When** integration tests are executed, **Then** all API endpoints should function correctly with real dependencies
2. **Given** a GitHub Actions workflow, **When** the workflow is triggered, **Then** integration tests should run automatically and report results
3. **Given** contract tests (smoke tests, startup tests), **When** executed, **Then** they should verify service registration, configuration, and basic application startup without database dependencies
4. **Given** E2E tests with database dependencies, **When** executed with Cosmos DB Emulator, **Then** they should verify full endpoint functionality with real database interactions
5. **Given** E2E tests requiring test isolation, **When** multiple tests run in sequence, **Then** each test should clean up after itself to prevent data pollution

---

### User Story 3 - CI/CD Test Automation (Priority: P3)

Development teams need automated test execution in GitHub Actions workflows to ensure continuous quality assurance and prevent regressions from reaching production, with consistent patterns across all Biotrackr microservices.

**Why this priority**: Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines ensures consistent quality gates and enables confident continuous deployment practices across all Biotrackr microservices.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering GitHub Actions workflows and verifying that all tests execute successfully with proper reporting and failure handling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request or code push, **When** GitHub Actions workflows are triggered, **Then** all unit and integration tests should execute automatically
2. **Given** test failures in the CI/CD pipeline, **When** the workflow completes, **Then** clear failure reports should be provided with actionable information
3. **Given** successful test execution, **When** the workflow completes, **Then** test coverage reports should be generated and made available
4. **Given** integration tests requiring Cosmos DB Emulator, **When** executed in CI/CD, **Then** they should use containerized Cosmos DB Emulator with proper connection configuration
5. **Given** parallel test execution, **When** contract tests and unit tests run concurrently, **Then** they should complete faster than sequential execution

### Edge Cases

- What happens when database is unavailable during integration tests?
- How does the system handle malformed date formats in various endpoints?
- What occurs when pagination parameters exceed reasonable limits?
- How are null or empty responses from the repository handled in endpoint handlers?
- What happens when configuration service is unavailable during startup?
- How does the API handle invalid or missing sleep data from external entities?
- What occurs when sleep duration calculations result in negative or zero values?
- How are date range queries handled when start date is after end date?
- What happens when sleep level data is incomplete or contains invalid stage names?
- How does the repository handle pagination with empty result sets?
- What occurs when the database container doesn't exist during initialization?
- How are SSL/TLS certificate validation issues handled in test database connections?
- What happens when tests run concurrently and share the same test database instance?
- How are test data conflicts prevented when multiple test methods execute in parallel?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-31

**Integration with Common Resolutions & Decision Records**:

The following clarifications have been integrated from established project patterns:

- **Q: How should Program.cs be excluded from code coverage?** → **A: Using [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] attribute directly in code** (per common-resolutions.md "Code Coverage Exclusions" - this works across all coverage tools unlike build configuration which only works locally)

- **Q: What connection mode should E2E tests use for test database emulator?** → **A: Gateway mode (HTTPS) instead of Direct mode (TCP+SSL)** (per common-resolutions.md "E2E Tests Fail with SSL negotiation failed" - Direct mode fails with self-signed certificates in emulators)

- **Q: How should test isolation be handled in E2E tests?** → **A: Clear database container before each test method** (per common-resolutions.md "E2E Tests Find More Documents Than Expected" - Collection fixtures share database instances, requiring explicit cleanup)

- **Q: Should services using HttpClient factory have duplicate registrations?** → **A: No, only register via AddHttpClient<T>** (per decision-records/2025-10-28-service-lifetime-registration.md - duplicate registrations cause the second to override the first, creating confusion)

- **Q: What test organization pattern should integration tests follow?** → **A: Separate Contract and E2E namespaces with xUnit test filters** (per decision-records/2025-10-28-integration-test-project-structure.md - enables parallel execution of fast tests)

- **Q: What permissions are required for test reporting in GitHub Actions?** → **A: Include checks: write permission** (per common-resolutions.md "Test Reporter Action Failing" - required for dorny/test-reporter@v1)

- **Q: Should working directory point to solution or test project?** → **A: Test project directory** (per common-resolutions.md "Incorrect Working Directory" - templates expect specific test project paths)
