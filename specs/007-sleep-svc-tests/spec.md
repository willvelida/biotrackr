## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete Unit Test Coverage for Missing Components (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need comprehensive unit tests for all Sleep Service components to ensure business logic correctness and meet the 70% code coverage threshold.

**Why this priority**: Current unit tests exist for services and repository but lack tests for the SleepWorker component and edge cases. Achieving 70% coverage is foundational for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `dotnet test` with coverage collection and verifying that overall line coverage reaches at least 70% across all Sleep Service components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the existing unit test suite, **When** code coverage is measured, **Then** it should reach at least 70% line coverage for the entire Biotrackr.Sleep.Svc project
2. **Given** Program.cs contains only DI registration and configuration, **When** coverage exclusions are configured, **Then** Program.cs should be excluded from coverage metrics via [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] attribute
3. **Given** SleepWorker requires testing, **When** creating unit tests, **Then** they should cover constructor initialization, successful execution, exception handling, and cancellation scenarios
4. **Given** service tests exist, **When** reviewing test completeness, **Then** edge cases like malformed JSON, null responses, and network errors should be covered
5. **Given** repository tests exist, **When** testing error scenarios, **Then** Cosmos DB exceptions (rate limiting, network failures, duplicate IDs) should be properly handled

---

### User Story 2 - Integration Test Project Creation (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need a properly structured integration test project following established patterns so that I can verify the Sleep Service behaves correctly with realistic dependencies.

**Why this priority**: Integration tests validate that components work together correctly and that external dependencies (Cosmos DB, Fitbit API) are properly integrated. Following the Weight Service pattern ensures consistency across the codebase.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating the project structure, running `dotnet build`, and verifying the project compiles successfully with all required dependencies.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Sleep Service solution exists, **When** the integration test project is created, **Then** it includes all required testing packages (xUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq, AutoFixture, coverlet.collector, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing)
2. **Given** the integration test project structure is defined, **When** reviewing the folder layout, **Then** Contract/, E2E/, Fixtures/, Collections/, and Helpers/ folders exist matching the Weight Service pattern
3. **Given** the test project is configured, **When** tests are discovered, **Then** the test runner recognizes all test classes and methods across both Contract and E2E namespaces
4. **Given** integration tests require configuration, **When** appsettings.Test.json is created, **Then** it contains test-specific connection strings and settings for local Cosmos DB Emulator

---

### User Story 3 - Contract Integration Tests (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need contract integration tests that verify dependency injection and service registration without external dependencies so that I can run fast tests in parallel with unit tests.

**Why this priority**: Contract tests validate the "contract" of the applicationâ€”that services are properly registered and the application can start. These tests are fast and can run in parallel with unit tests without requiring Cosmos DB Emulator.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running contract tests in isolation using `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Contract"` and verifying they execute quickly (under 5 seconds total) without external dependencies.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application uses dependency injection, **When** ProgramStartupTests verify service registration, **Then** all required services (CosmosClient, SecretClient, repositories, services) can be resolved from the service provider
2. **Given** services have defined lifetimes, **When** ServiceRegistrationTests verify lifetimes, **Then** Singleton services (CosmosClient, SecretClient) return the same instance, Scoped services return the same instance within a scope, and Transient services (FitbitService) return different instances
3. **Given** the application can start, **When** testing application bootstrapping, **Then** the host builds successfully without runtime exceptions
4. **Given** configuration is required, **When** testing with in-memory configuration, **Then** all required configuration values (keyvaulturl, managedidentityclientid, cosmosdbendpoint, applicationinsightsconnectionstring) are accessible

---

### User Story 4 - E2E Integration Tests with Cosmos DB (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I need end-to-end integration tests that verify data persistence and retrieval with a real Cosmos DB instance so that I can ensure the complete workflow functions correctly.

**Why this priority**: E2E tests validate the full workflow including external dependencies. While important, they are slower and require Cosmos DB Emulator setup, making them lower priority than unit and contract tests.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running E2E tests with Cosmos DB Emulator using `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~E2E"` and verifying they create, read, and cleanup test data successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a test Cosmos DB container is available, **When** CosmosRepositoryTests create a sleep document, **Then** it persists with the correct structure, partition key (documentType), and can be retrieved by ID
2. **Given** the SleepService orchestrates data operations, **When** SleepServiceTests verify MapAndSaveDocument, **Then** it correctly transforms SleepResponse into SleepDocument and saves it to Cosmos DB
3. **Given** the SleepWorker executes its workflow, **When** SleepWorkerTests run end-to-end, **Then** it retrieves sleep data from mocked Fitbit service, maps it to documents, and saves to Cosmos DB
4. **Given** E2E tests create test data, **When** each test completes, **Then** the test container is cleaned up to ensure test isolation (no leftover data affects subsequent tests)
5. **Given** Cosmos DB connection configuration, **When** tests use Gateway mode (ConnectionMode.Gateway), **Then** they work reliably with the local Cosmos DB Emulator without SSL negotiation failures

---

### User Story 5 - GitHub Actions Workflow Integration (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I need integration tests to run automatically in the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline so that test failures are caught before deployment.

**Why this priority**: Automated testing in CI/CD prevents regressions from reaching production. This is important but depends on having working tests first (P1-P2 priorities).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering the workflow on a pull request and verifying all test jobs (unit, contract, E2E) execute successfully and report results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the deploy-sleep-service.yml workflow exists, **When** contract tests are configured, **Then** they run in parallel with unit tests without requiring Cosmos DB Emulator
2. **Given** E2E tests require Cosmos DB, **When** the workflow is configured, **Then** the E2E test job includes Cosmos DB Emulator service (mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator:latest) matching the Weight Service pattern
3. **Given** tests complete in the workflow, **When** coverage reports are generated, **Then** they are uploaded as artifacts and published using dorny/test-reporter@v1 with checks: write permission
4. **Given** test failures occur, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** detailed error messages and logs are available in the GitHub Actions summary
5. **Given** the workflow uses reusable templates, **When** test jobs are defined, **Then** they use correct working-directory paths (e.g., ./src/Biotrackr.Sleep.Svc/Biotrackr.Sleep.Svc.UnitTests for unit tests, not the solution directory)

- How does the system handle empty sleep responses from Fitbit API?
- What occurs when Cosmos DB connection fails during E2E test setup?
- How does the system behave when attempting to create duplicate sleep documents with the same ID?
- What happens if the Fitbit API returns malformed JSON that fails deserialization?
- How does the system handle network timeouts when calling the Fitbit API?
- What occurs when the mocked SecretClient fails to return an access token?
- How does the service handle invalid date formats in sleep data?
- What happens when E2E tests run concurrently and try to access the same test container?
- How does the system behave when IHostApplicationLifetime.StopApplication is called multiple times?
