# Specification Quality Checklist: Sleep Service Test Coverage and Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 31, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - **Note**: Test infrastructure specs may include technical details for tooling/packages
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Test quality and reliability benefits development team
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Clear acceptance scenarios and business value explained
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - Focuses on coverage %, execution time, pass rates
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Follows Activity Service test spec pattern

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items pass validation. Specification follows established pattern from Activity Service (005-activity-svc-tests) and Weight Service (003-weight-svc-integration-tests) integration test specifications.

**Key Validation Points**:
- User stories are prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
- Functional requirements cover all test types (unit, contract, E2E)
- Success criteria are measurable (coverage %, execution time, pass rates)
- Edge cases comprehensively identified
- Dependencies clearly documented (Cosmos DB Emulator, GitHub Actions templates)
- Out of scope items prevent scope creep

**Note**: Test infrastructure specifications appropriately include technical details about testing frameworks and packages, which differs from feature specifications that must be technology-agnostic. This is consistent with established patterns in the codebase.

## Notes

Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).
