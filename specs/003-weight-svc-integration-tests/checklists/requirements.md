# Specification Quality Checklist: Weight Service Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass successfully. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Details

**Content Quality**: ✅
- Specification focuses on testing capabilities and outcomes
- No specific implementation technologies mentioned in requirements
- Written from developer perspective (appropriate for internal testing feature)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅
- All requirements are specific and testable
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (80% coverage, 30 second execution time, 2 second contract tests)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases comprehensively cover failure scenarios
- Scope is bounded to integration testing of Weight Service components

**Feature Readiness**: ✅
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories
- Four prioritized user stories cover all testing scenarios
- Success criteria are measurable and verifiable
- No implementation leakage detected
