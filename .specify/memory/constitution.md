# Biotrackr Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST adhere to engineering fundamentals: SOLID principles, Gang of Four design patterns applied contextually, 
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid). Code MUST be readable, 
maintainable, and tell a clear story. Every class, method, and variable MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility. 
Cognitive load MUST be minimized through clear naming, appropriate abstractions, and consistent patterns.

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces bugs, accelerates feature development, and enables confident refactoring. 
Quality gates prevent technical debt accumulation that degrades system maintainability over time.

### II. Comprehensive Testing Strategy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Testing MUST follow the test pyramid: comprehensive unit tests (≥80% coverage), focused integration tests for service 
boundaries, and strategic end-to-end tests for critical user journeys. TDD approach STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for new features: 
write tests first, ensure they fail, then implement. All pull requests MUST include tests for new functionality and 
regression tests for bug fixes. Tests MUST be fast, reliable, and independent.

**Rationale**: Comprehensive testing enables confident refactoring, prevents regressions, and serves as living documentation. 
The test pyramid optimizes for fast feedback while ensuring system reliability at all levels.

### III. User Experience Consistency
User interfaces and APIs MUST provide consistent, predictable experiences. REST APIs MUST follow OpenAPI specifications 
with consistent error handling, response formats, and HTTP status codes. UI components MUST follow established design 
patterns and accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum). All user-facing features MUST be tested across supported 
platforms and devices. Error messages MUST be clear, actionable, and user-friendly.

**Rationale**: Consistent experiences reduce user cognitive load, improve adoption, and decrease support overhead. 
Standardized patterns enable faster development and easier maintenance.

### IV. Performance & Scalability
All services MUST meet defined performance requirements: API responses <200ms p95, database queries optimized for expected 
load, and efficient resource utilization. Performance testing MUST be included for critical paths. Scalability 
considerations MUST be documented for each service. Monitoring and alerting MUST be implemented for performance 
degradation detection. Database design MUST consider query patterns and indexing strategies.

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction and system costs. Proactive performance design prevents 
costly refactoring and enables sustainable growth.

### V. Technical Debt Management
Technical debt MUST be explicitly identified, documented, and tracked via GitHub Issues. When debt is incurred, 
consequences and remediation plans MUST be documented. Regular debt assessment MUST occur during sprint planning. 
High-impact debt MUST be prioritized for resolution. All team members MUST proactively identify and report technical 
debt through GitHub Issues with clear impact assessments and remediation recommendations.

**Rationale**: Managed technical debt prevents system degradation while enabling pragmatic delivery trade-offs. 
Explicit tracking ensures debt doesn't accumulate invisibly until it becomes overwhelming.

## Quality Attributes

Balancing testability, maintainability, scalability, performance, security, and understandability is REQUIRED for all 
architectural decisions. Trade-offs MUST be explicitly documented with rationale. Security considerations MUST be 
integrated into design from the start, not retrofitted. All external dependencies MUST be evaluated for security, 
maintenance status, and licensing compatibility.

## Development Workflow

### Requirements Analysis
Requirements MUST be carefully reviewed with assumptions documented explicitly. Edge cases MUST be identified and 
addressed. Risk assessment MUST be performed for all significant changes. Acceptance criteria MUST be testable and 
unambiguous. All requirements gaps or ambiguities MUST result in GitHub Issues for clarification.

### Implementation Excellence
Implement the best design that meets architectural requirements without over-engineering. Balance engineering excellence 
with delivery needs - favor good over perfect, but never compromise on fundamentals. Anticipate future needs through 
extensible design but avoid premature optimization. All significant design decisions MUST be documented in ADRs 
(Architecture Decision Records).

### Code Review Standards
All code changes MUST be reviewed by at least one team member. Reviews MUST verify: adherence to coding standards, 
test coverage adequacy, performance considerations, security implications, and documentation completeness. 
Feedback MUST be clear, actionable, and constructive. Complex changes MUST include architecture review.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All pull requests MUST verify compliance with these 
principles. Complexity MUST be justified with clear rationale. When principles conflict, decisions MUST be documented 
with trade-off analysis. Constitution amendments MUST include impact analysis, migration plan, and team approval.

Regular compliance reviews MUST occur quarterly to assess adherence and identify improvement opportunities. 
Non-compliance issues MUST be tracked via GitHub Issues with remediation plans.
